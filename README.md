This repository contains a structured list of topics and subtopics for placement preparation in the following subjects:

- **Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS)**
- **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**
- **Computer Networking**
- **Operating Systems**

Each section is tailored for SDE roles and focuses on the most important concepts frequently asked in interviews.

## 1. Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS)

### Core Concepts
- **Class and Object**: Definition, constructors, destructors, real-world examples.
- **Inheritance**: Single, Multiple, Multilevel, Hierarchical, Hybrid.
- **Encapsulation**: Data hiding and access modifiers (public, private, protected).
- **Abstraction**: Interfaces vs Abstract classes, real-world examples.
- **Polymorphism**: Compile-time (method overloading), Runtime (method overriding).

### Advanced Topics
- Static vs Dynamic Binding.
- Virtual functions and pure virtual functions.
- Operator overloading and function overloading.
- Exception handling in OOPs.

### Design Patterns
- Singleton Pattern.
- Factory Pattern.
- Observer Pattern.

## 2. Database Management Systems (DBMS)

### Core Concepts
#### Introduction to DBMS:
- Advantages of DBMS over file systems.
- Types of DBMS: Hierarchical, Network, Relational, Object-oriented.

#### ER Models:
- Attributes, relationships, entities.
- Cardinality and participation constraints.

#### Relational Database Model:
- Relational schema and keys (primary, foreign, candidate).
- Relational algebra operations (selection, projection, join).

#### Normalization:
- Normal forms: 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF.
- Lossless join decomposition.

#### Transactions:
- ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
- Concurrency control methods:
  - Lock-based protocols (shared/exclusive locks).
  - Timestamp ordering protocols.

#### SQL Basics:
- SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements.
- Joins: Inner join, outer join (left/right/full).

## 3. Computer Networking

### Basic Concepts
- Types of networks:
  - LAN, WAN, MAN.
  - Peer-to-peer vs Client-server models.
- Network topology:
  - Star, Ring, Bus, Mesh topologies.

### OSI Model
- Layers: Physical layer to Application layer.
- Functions of each layer.
- Protocols used at each layer.

### TCP/IP Model
#### Key Protocols:
- HTTP/HTTPS
- FTP/SFTP
- DNS

### Routing Algorithms
- Shortest path algorithms: Dijkstra's Algorithm.
- Distance vector routing vs Link state routing.

## 4. Operating Systems

### Core Concepts
#### Introduction to OS:
- Types of operating systems: Batch OS, Time-sharing OS.
- Functions of an OS: Process management, memory management.

#### Processes and Threads:
- Process life cycle (new → ready → running → waiting → terminated).
- Multithreading models: User-level vs Kernel-level threads.

#### CPU Scheduling:
##### Algorithms:
  - FCFS (First Come First Serve).
  - SJF (Shortest Job First) – preemptive/non-preemptive.
  - Round Robin Scheduling.

#### Deadlocks:
  - Conditions for deadlock (Mutual exclusion).
  - Deadlock prevention techniques.

#### Memory Management:
  - Paging vs Segmentation.
  - Page replacement algorithms:
    - FIFO
    - LRU

#### File Systems:
  - File allocation methods: Contiguous allocation.
